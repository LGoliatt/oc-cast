# 🌍 OC‑CAST: A Sediment-Informed Machine Learning Framework for Global Organic Carbon Prediction

A robust machine learning framework to predict organic carbon (OC) concentration in riverine sediments, integrating feature selection, ensemble modeling, and uncertainty quantification.

---

## 🚀 Overview

`oc-cast` is an optimized pipeline designed to estimate sedimentary organic carbon using global datasets and geochemical variables. It combines data preprocessing, feature selection, ensemble learning, and Monte Carlo simulations to deliver accurate and interpretable predictions.

### 🔍 Key Contributions

- Ensemble models accurately predict OC in river sediments at a global scale.  
- Feature selection enhances model parsimony with minimal performance loss.  
- Fe₂O₃, Al₂O₃, and P₂O₅ identified as key geochemical predictors of OC.  
- Monte Carlo simulations are used for robust uncertainty quantification.  
- Integrated framework connects model tuning with geochemical interpretation.
